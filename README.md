# Introduction
I use this checklist to quickly do code reviews.

It has 5 sections, focusing on Requirements, Health, Quality, Reviewing, and Testing.

| **Icon** | **Type**                  | **Approach**                                                                                 | **Examples**                                                                                                               | **Why**                                                                 |

| ‚ôæÔ∏è       | **Understanding Requirements** | Create detailed documentation of the requirements and ensure the client and your entire team have a crystal clear understanding of them. | **Verify** `ProcessOrder` method aligns with requirements. (https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-nasa-does-software-testing-and-qa) | Misunderstanding requirements can lead to building the wrong product, resulting in wasted time, resources, and potential project failure. |
| üöÄ       | **System Health**              | Security, Performance, Dependency, and Maturity Model.                                      | **Security**: Validate user input in `Login` method to prevent SQL injection.<br>**Performance**: Use Visual Studio Profiler to optimize `LoadCustomerData`.<br>**Dependency Management**: Update Newtonsoft.Json library and remove unused dependencies.<br>**Maturity Model**: Implement CMMI practices to evaluate and improve process capabilities. | Neglecting system integrity can expose the system to severe security breaches, performance bottlenecks, and unstable dependencies, ultimately leading to loss of user trust and system failure. |
| üßä       | **Code Quality**              | 1. SOLID Principles<br>2. Naming Conventions<br>3. File Structure<br>4. Indentation and Spacing<br>5. Braces<br>6. Comments<br>7. Error Handling<br>8. Method Length<br>9. Magic Numbers<br>10. Null Checks<br>11. Consistency | **SOLID Principles**: Adhere to SOLID principles to ensure robust code design. (https://github.com/Kungfoowiz/SOLID-Programming-Examples/blob/main/MessengerApp.cs)<br>**Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names like `CalculateInvoiceTotal`.<br>**File Structure**: Place each class in its own file named after the class.<br>**Indentation**: Consistently use 4 spaces for indentation.<br>**Braces**: Always use braces for `if` statements and loops.<br>**Comments**: Use XML comments for public methods.<br>**Error Handling**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.<br>**Method Length**: Keep methods short and focused, such as a method that only validates user input.<br>**Magic Numbers**: Use constants instead of hardcoded values.<br>**Null Checks**: Always check for null to avoid `NullReferenceException`.<br>**Consistency**: Ensure consistent style throughout the project. | Poor code quality can lead to bugs, technical debt, and increased maintenance costs. |
| üêû       | **Code Review**               | Review code quality to identify bugs.                                                        | Use Microsoft **Copilot** and **manual checks** to fix a concurrency issue in `ProcessOrder`.                                      | Skipping reviews can result in persistent bugs, missed opportunities for improvement, and higher long-term costs due to compounded technical issues. |
| üß™       | **Testing**                   | Comprehensive unit, integration, E2E, and manual tests.                                      | **Manual Testing**: Perform tests manually to identify issues that automated tests may miss. Write **Unit Tests** for `CalculateOrderTotal`. | Inadequate testing can lead to undetected bugs, system failures, and a lack of confidence in the software's reliability and functionality. |
